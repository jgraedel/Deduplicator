Deduplicator
============

###Goal of Project
  My aim is to approach duplication from the sub-atomic level and remove the idea of exact clones from the world of Star Trek fantasy and disbelief to an actual reality. Objects are not to be viewed as a *WHOLE*; rather, they are simply a collection of atoms arranged in a certain manner. By approaching an object from this standpoint the idea of duplication becomes much easier to fathom.

###Progress
  I have been experimenting with the backend technology of 3d printing to try to use a similar idea but using atoms instead of plastic filling. I feel that I am on the right track for this project and have been having some minor successses in terms of creating a successful scan of an object on the sub-atomic level (although the printing aspect is still proving difficult).
